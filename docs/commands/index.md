# Redocly OpenAPI CLI commands

Redocly OpenAPI CLI currently supports the following commands:

* [bundle](bundle.md)
* [join](join.md)
* [lint](lint.md) 
* [login](login.md)
* [logout](logout.md)
* [preview-docs](preview-docs.md)
* [push](push.md)
* [split](split.md)
* [stats](stats.md)

To define the behavior of the commands, you can use configuration files:

- `.redocly.yaml` - define the location of your root files, linting rules, and reference docs configuration information.
- `.redocly.lint-ignore.yaml` - ignore specific lint messages.

For more information about configuration, please refer to the [corresponding](../configuration/index.mdx) section.
