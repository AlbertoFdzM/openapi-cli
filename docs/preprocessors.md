# Preprocessors

> NOTE: this feature is experimental. Modifying your data may break codeframes in errors.

## Rationale

There might appear such situation, when the input data should be mutated before applying default rules and/or bundling. For this case, you might want to run certain custom preprocessors before rules.

You can do it with `preprocessors`.

## Usage

TBD
